My first project is BioMarketStore.com -- which I plan to use to develop my Ruby on Rails skills, along with supporting packages, etc. 
This project creates a new supply chain for bioplastics products Global to create a global market. 
What makes it unique will be all the pricing will be published with no login required. 
With login-in the user will get access to a free "PO Generator" which is an elaborate ala carte ordering system. 
This system will drive inefficiencies out of the process of "Going Green" for the food service industry. 
It will do this by the following:
--enable recurring "sub container" (or pallet only) products, pre-loaded, pre-wrapped and labeled in China, Taiwain, Japan, etc. 
--eliminate the costly and risky process of LTL (less than truckload) shipments for sustainable disposables in food service
--introduce a subscription or recurring solution set 
--abstract importing, etc. 
--"see the process" from the buyer's point of view 
--create a foundation for blockchain-type transactions 
--provide order tracking
--dovetail with in-house CRM, marketing, etc.
